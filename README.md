# Docker-and-kubernete
In this project:
  - Deploying a simple guestbook application that uses in-memory storage to retain the guestbook entries. 
  - Afterward, deploying a multi-tier web application that consists of a web front end, a Redis master and replicated slaves for storage,
  - As well as an analyzer service that analyzes the tone of entries left in the guestbook(created a free instance of Tone Analyzer in My personal IBM Cloud account).
